Virtual Function Daemon - VFD

VFD is a daemon which is used to configures NIC PF/VFs in ways which are not possible through 
the standard ixgbe driver.

The directories here contain the VFD code and some system tools such as the iplex 
command line interface tool which is used to interact with the daemon.
