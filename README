   



  VFD OVERVIEW 
  Much  in  the  way  that  a guest operating system requires a 
  hypervisor to provide accessibility to  the  underlying  real 
  operating  system and hardware, as well as to ensure policies 
  are enforced, there is a similar need for  a  NIC  hypervisor 
  when  virtual  functions (VFs) are directly available through 
  SR-IOV[1]. While a bit more lightweight  than  a  hypervisor, 
  VFd  can  be  thought of as the NIC hypervisor inasmuch as it 
  provides the policy enforcement  through  both  configuration 
  and real-time validation of guest[2] requests.

  Figure 1: General relationship of NIC, VFs, "guests" and VFd 
   
  Figure  1  illustrates the relationship between the NIC (PF), 
  the configured VFs, the guests, and  VFd.  VFd  acts  as  the 
  policy  implementor by configuring each VF to stipulate which 
  VLAN(s) a VF will receive traffic from,  and  be  allowed  to 
  send  traffic  to. In addition, VFd will configure the PF and 
  VFs to: 
   
      
      
        
          
       * Strip and insert the outer VLAN tag. 
          
       * Enable  NIC  bridging  allowing  guest  to  guest 
         communication. 
          
       * Allow  unknown  unicast traffic to be sent to one 
         or more guests. 
          
       * Allow  broadcast  and  multicast  traffic  to  be 
         received/transmitted by a guest. 
          
       * Enforce  MAC  and/or  VLAN spoofing (drop spoofed 
         packets). 
          
       * Configure multiple MAC addresses for the VF. 
          
       * Enable and configure DCB quality of service. 
      
      
   
   
  In addition to  the  NIC  configurations  listed  above,  VFd 
  provides  the  means  to  access the packet and byte counters 
  allowing for them to be available to the user; something that 
  is not possible when using a kernel driver to manage the VFs. 
  Statistics, both at the PF and VF level include: 
   
      
      
        
          
       * Packet counts for inbound (Rx) and outbound (Tx) 
          
       * Byte counts, Tx and Rx 
          
       * Error packet count 
          
       * Count of spoofed packets 
      
      
   
   

  The Guests 





  While the illustration shows only one VF  allocated  to  each 
  guest,  it  is  possible  to  allocate  multiple  VFs,  from  
  different PFs, to a single guest. Of the various guests shown 
  in  figure  1,  two  are illustrations of how guest operating 
  systems, virtual machines[3],  can  have  one,  or  more,  VF 
  allocated  as an SR-IOV device. Bare metal applications (e.g. 
  DPDK applications) are also able  to  make  use  of  the  VFs 
  offered  up  by the NIC and generally use the NIC's kernel VF 
  interface/driver to do so. 

  Inside of a VM 





  When a guest operating system is created, and one or more VFs 
  is  attached  to  it,  the  VF  appears  as a virtual network 
  interface and standard kernel drivers can be  used  to  treat 
  the  interface  as  an ordinary ethernet device, configurable 
  with well known tools like ifconfig and ip, or a DPDK  driver 
  may  be used to allow DPDK applications to run in the virtual 
  machine. 

  What VFd Is Not 





  While VFd is implemented as a DPDK application, primarily  to 
  easily  access  the  network  devices,  VFd  is  not a packet 
  processor, and does not insert itself into the  path  of  any 
  packet. 



  NECESSITY 
  A  valid,  and  often  asked,  question is why exactly is VFd 
  needed? It would seem that if the hardware offers all of  the 
  sophistication  that  they  do, that the kernel drivers would 
  supply the means to configure the hardware such that  all  of 
  the  features could be used. However, at least at the present 
  time,   this   isn't   the   case,  and  there  are  several  
  configuration  options which unfortunately cannot be achieved 
  through the kernel drivers. In order to take  full  advantage 
  of  the  hardware, an independent configuration tool, VFd, is 
  required. 
   

  Real-time Authorisation 





  In addition to managing the configurations of  all  VFs,  VFd 
  also provides real-time policy enforcement when a guest makes 
  a request to configure  it's  interface.  The  following  are 
  examples  of  guest actions which require the approval of VFd 
  before the requested changes are actually applied o the VF: 
   
   
      
        
     * Add or modify VLAN ID(s) 
        
     * Change default MAC address 
        
     * Add/delete alternate (white list) MAC addresses 
        
     * Set the MTU value 
   
   
   
  VFd will authorise (ACK) any request provided that the change 
  is  within  the  policy  as  defined to VFd via the PF and VF 
  configuration files. For example, if  a  guests  requests  to 
  add/modify  a  VLAN  ID,  it  will  be  permitted only if the 
  requested ID has been defined in the VF's configuration file. 
  MTU  changes  are  limited by the overall maximum MTU defined 
  for each device in the main VFd configuration  file.  Looking 
  from a policy assurance point of view, VFd provides a service 
  that would  otherwise  not  be  available  even  if  all  NIC 
  features  could  be  exercised  through  the  kernel  driver  
  interface as the drivers provide no mechanism to call out  to 
  an independent authority to make these kinds of decisions. 
   



  VF CONFIGURATION FEATURES 
  The  following  sections  provide a high level explanation of 
  NIC features which may be managed using VFd. The purpose here 
  is  to  outline  what  can be done; for information on how to 
  actually implement these, please  refer  to  the  VFd  User's 
  Guide. 

  Anti-Spoofing 





  Spoofing  is  used  in  reference  to  a machine on a network 
  pretending to be another machine, usually by using the  other 
  machine's  MAC  address,  or using an unauthorised VLAN ID in 
  packets, or possibly both. VFd forces anti-spoofing  settings 
  to  be  enabled  for  VLAN IDs[4] under the assumption that a 
  guest assigned to a VLAN must always send  packets  with  the 
  assigned ID, but may send with any source MAC address. 

  VLAN Considerations 





  The  list  of  approved  VLAN  IDs  that  are given in a VF's 
  configuration file  limit  the  packets  that  the  NIC  will 
  forward  to  the  VF. Only packets containing one of the VLAN 
  IDs in the list are allowed to pass. VFd does not permit a VF 
  to  see all packets regardless of VLAN ID, nor does it permit 
  untagged packets from being written onto a VF's queue.

  ) 
  Figure 2: On transmit, insert VLAN tag into  untagged  packet 
  (top  to  middle), and into a single tagged packet (middle to 
  bottom). On receipt, the reverse. 
   

  Stripping and Inserting VLAN Tags 
  The VLAN ID, or tag, may be automatically removed,  stripped, 
  as  a packet is received, and automatically inserted prior to 
  transmission; both of these actions are performed by the  NIC 
  and  thus are as efficient as is possible. Whether or not one 
  or multiple VLAN IDs are configured for a VF,  the  stripping 
  of  the  tag is straight forward: the tag is removed from the 
  packet before the packet is presented to the VF. For the case 
  where  a  VF  receives  packets  with  a single VLAN tag, the 
  process of  insertion  is  also  straight  forward:  the  NIC 
  inserts  the  tag into the packet before transmission. When a 
  VF is permitted send and receive packets using one of several 
  VLAN   IDs,   the   insertion  of  the  correct  ID  is  the  
  responsibility of the sending process, and cannot be added to 
  the packet by the NIC. 

  Q in Q Stripping 
  Packets  arriving  with multiple embedded VLAN IDs (figure 2, 
  bottom), also known as Q  in  Q,  are  subject  to  the  same 
  stripping  practice  as  described  above. Only the first, or 
  outer tag, is removed from a received packet,  and  only  the 
  outer   tag   will   be  inserted  on  transmit.  Using  the  
  illustration as  an  example,  the  middle  packet  would  be 
  delivered to the guest after stripping, and the bottom packet 
  would be transmitted. It is the responsibility of  the  guest 
  software  (kernel  driver,  or  DPDK application) to properly 
  distinguish packets, if necessary, based on the VLAN ID which 
  remains in the packet. 

  MAC Addresses 





  By default the NIC generates a random MAC address for each VF 
  that is created. This random address is known as the  default 
  MAC,  and  is  visible to the guest (e.g. it is what would be 
  displayed in the output of an ifconfig  command).  If  it  is 
  necessary,  the default MAC address can be supplied in a VF's 
  configuration file which  will  replace  the  random  address 
  generated by the NIC. 

  Guest Generated MAC Addresses 
  It is sometimes desirable for a guest to generate the default 
  MAC, and possibly other white-list MAC  addresses.  VFd  will 
  approve these guest requests provided that: 
      
      
        
          
       * The  address  is  not in use by another VF on the 
         same PF. 
          
       * The number of addresses  currently  allocated  on 
         the VF is not at maximum 
          
       * THe  number  of  addresses currently allocated on 
         the PF is not at maximum. 
      
      
   
   
  Guest allocated MAC addresses remain in place  until  the  VF 
  configuration  is  deleted. When the configuration is deleted 
  any guest allocated  addresses  are  replaced  by  a  single, 
  randomly generated, default address. 

  Broadcast, Unknown Unicast, Multicast Traffic 





  VFd allows each VF to be configured to cause the NIC to allow 
  or reject each of these types of traffic.  The  configuration 
  of a VF provides for three independent settings allowing each 
  to be managed separately. All  packets  falling  within  each 
  traffic  type  are  subject  to  VLAN  filtering;  it  is not 
  possible for a VF to see all *-cast traffic. 



  PF CONFIGURATION FEATURES 
  There are several configuration  options  that  VFd  provides 
  which  apply  to all VFs on a given NIC, or to all PFs on the 
  NIC, and thus are supplied  in  the  main  VFd  configuration 
  file.  These  configuration  options  are  described  in  the 
  following sections. 

  Loopback 





  By default the NIC bridge is disabled which forces  a  packet 
  to  be  transmitted  to the switch, and then back, should two 
  guests using VFs on the same PF need to communicate. Enabling 
  the  loopback  option for a VF will enable the NIC bridge and 
  allow packets to be exchanged between VFs on the  PF  without 
  having to travel onto the real network. 

  Flow Control 





  While   evidence   suggests  that  using  flow  control  can  
  significantly impact performance (max throughput),  VFd  does 
  allow flow control on the NIC to be enabled. 

  Quality of Service 





  VFd  is  able  to  configure  all  PFs  to  enable Datacenter 
  Bridging (DCB) quality of service.  This  defines  a  set  of 
  traffic classes and allows the assignment of bandwidth shares 
  (percentages) for each VF with respect to each traffic class. 

  MTU Limit 





  The overall maximum MTU limit can be set  on  each  PF.  When 
  set,  an  attempt  by  a guest to increase the MTU value over 
  this limit will be rejected. 



  TRAFFIC MIRRORING 
  Traffic mirroring is a  specialised  form  of  loopback.  VFd 
  provides  for  real-time mirror configuration, independent of 
  VF configuration files, allowing for inbound[5], outbound, or 
  all  of a VF's traffic to be duplicated and passed to another 
  VF on the same PF.

  Mirroring  traffic  locally  has  benefits  with  respect  to 
  debugging  connectivity issues as well as application issues. 
  However, there are potential impacts, some  serious,  to  the 
  overall  throughput  of the NIC when traffic is mirrored over 
  the NIC bridge. For instance,  a  badly  behaved  application 
  used  as  the receiver for mirrored traffic has the potential 
  to block all traffic to the source VF.
