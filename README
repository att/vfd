Virtual Function Daemon 


VFD is a daemon which is used to configures NIC PF/VFs in ways which are not possible through 
the standard ixgbe driver.

The directories here contain the VFD code and some system tools such as the iplex 
command line interface tool which is used to interact with the daemon. 


Some requirements:
   - DPDK version 16.11
	  1) clone http://dpdk.org/git/dpdk
	  2) run 'git checkout v16.11
	  3) build DPDK

   - Linux kernel version  3.13 or later.  (VFd may execute on earlier kernels,
     however odd behavour has been observed with respect to packet dropping in one 
     or both directions with seem to be related to shared memory.)
