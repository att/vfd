Virtual Function Daemon 

See the main or nic_agnostic branches for the complete readme.

This branch has been altered to allow it to build the latest code
(merged in from nic_agnostic) with older versions of DPDK. It has
been specifically tested with 17.08. 

The main difference is there is now a typedef used for the pf-id
variable passed into most functions allowing it to be int-8 or int-16
depending on flavour of DPDK (17.11 changed it from 8 bit to 16 bit).

The primary reason for building this was to verify the changes that
were made to VFd on an older DPDK as there are some odd issues 
(memory and cpu stalls) that have been reported that we have not
been able to conclusively determine the source of the problem (our
code, or something underlying in the new DPDK).
