This directory contains patches that must be applied against DPDK in order to 
support VFd.  These patches, along with the command(s) to apply them to DPDK 
should be described below.  Patches will be removed from this directory when 
they are available in the current DPDK release. 

Patch naming convention in this directory is dpdk<release>-<patchname> where
release is something liek 1708 and indicates the release of DPDK to which the
patch should be applied. 

Patches should be kept long enough for us to revert back 18 months.

The apply_patches.ksh will easily apply all patches to a given version or 
verify:
	apply_patches.ksh [-n] [-s] [-V] version

	where:
		-n == no execute
		-s == sumarise and check

	All patches matching dpdk<version>- will be applied unless -V is given.
	When -V is given each matching patch file will be verified -- the user 
	will be prompted whether or not to apply the patch. 


To manually apply patches, the following commands are probably useful and make 
the assumption that VFD_PATH is the path to the VFd src directory.

cd $RTE_SDK
git apply --ignore-whitespace $VFD_PATH/dpdk_patches/dpdk-dev-net-ixgbe-fix-VF-RX-hang.patch
