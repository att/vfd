This directory contains patches that must be applied against DPDK in order to 
support VFd.  These patches, along with the command(s) to apply them to DPDK 
should be described below.  Patches will be removed from this directory when 
they are available in the current DPDK release. 

We assume that VFD_SRC is the path to the VFd src directory.

dpdk-ixgbe_pf_host_configure.patch
This patch prevents the PF code in DPDK from returning a failure indication when a 
set macvlan callback is made.  This is a work around; the final fix in DPDK will be 
more complex

cd $RTE_SDK
git apply --ignore-whitespace $VFD_PATH/dpdk_patches/dpdk-ixgbe_pf_host_configure.patch

Starting in 2018, patches will be named with a leading dpdk<yymm>- to indicate
the release year and month (dpdk) that the patch applies to.  Patches will be 
removed after a bit of time, but should allow for the regression of dpdk by 
a couple of releases in order to evaluate VFd code against older DPDK versions
if necessary.

dpdk 1802 patches:
dpdk1802-ixgbe_macvlan.patch
	This patch prevents RX hang for ixgbe controlled devices

	cd $RTE_SDK
	git apply --ignore-whitespace $VFD_PATH/dpdk_patches/dpdk1802-ixgbe_macvlan.patch
